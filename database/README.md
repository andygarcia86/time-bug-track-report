# Database folder

In this folder we can find the Database backups and also the scripts folder history.

Each script file have the following file name name convention: yyyymmddxx.sql where:

 - yyyy: is the year where the script was created.
 - mm: is the month where the script was created.
 - dd: is the day where the script was created.
 - xx: is a sequence number starting from 01 for each day.

You can also add an small description of the script, for example something like: `2020110301 - Update user name.sql`
